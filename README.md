# Dashboards in Superset
Here I want to show several dashboards representing key metrics for a mobile application users. A little background information: the app consists of news feed and messenger. So the dashboards aim to answer product related questions such as: How many daily active users (DAU) we have? How are new users distributed by source of customer acquisition? Or what about user retention? etc. All dashboards I share here are interactive. 

[This dashboard](https://superset.lab.karpov.courses/superset/dashboard/1803/) shows the overview of key metrics of news feed users. There you can see total number of unique users, DAU, WAU, MAU, CTR, user activity and other metrics. I also added filters to show the information in different data slices (by gender, operational system Android/iOS, acquisition source, age group). 

[This dashboard](https://superset.lab.karpov.courses/superset/dashboard/1859/) presents key characteristics in real time (DAU, users joined today by source of acquisition, user activity today, 1 day ago and 1 week ago, etc).

[Here](https://superset.lab.karpov.courses/superset/dashboard/1896/) you can see user decomposition by week: how many new users joined the app, how many left and how many retained by each week.

[Feed and messenger](https://superset.lab.karpov.courses/superset/dashboard/1874/) dashboard combines the info of users of news feed and messenger and answers questions such as how many users use both messenger and news feed, how many do not use messenger at all, and how mesages, likes, views are distributed.

[This dashboard](https://superset.lab.karpov.courses/superset/dashboard/1887/) shows user retention within last 20 days by source of acquisition, whether it is organic or advertisment. Users by their start date (Y-axis) are colored in black and you can see how many are left by each day (X-axis)
